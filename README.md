Overview of Project

The project compares success and failures of different plays based on their launch date and funding goals. Data is collected for Excel sheets and then tabulated in terms of success or failure based on launch dates and funding goals. The project tests the skill in Excel usage, particularly in pivot tables and count if command constructs.


Purpose:

This project is a comparative study of how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

Analysis and Challenges

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date:

Overall, most projects were a success until December when the failure rate and the cancellation rate exceeded the success rate. The cancellation rate was non-existent in the month of October and the data had a discontinuity. The success rate for year was 61.28%.

 Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals:
Fund Raising Goals were analyzed to find the correlation between success and failure. It was shown that the projects were successful until their funding goals reached $25000.  Then they became successful again between $35000 and $50,000. After $50,000 the failure jumped to 87%.

The moral of the story may be that low funding goals may be more successful.


Challenges and Difficulties Encountered: 

Discontinuous data for the month of October and sparse data towards the end of the year. It seemed that most productive months were the summer months of May and June.

Results

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The launch data matters. Plays launched in the summer were more successful than those launched in the December.  The last quarter of the year shows decline in successful launches.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The success and failure graphs zig zag, and failures become prominent in $25000 to $35000 range and then after $50,000 there is 87% failure rate. The outcome graphs do not paint a realistic picture. More money or more investment generally produces better results.

 What are some limitations of this dataset?
Data set based on Fund Raising Goals goes up to $50,000 and the data is sparse after $35000. Data shows little activity in the 4th Quarter. Success and Failure are defined by only two variables: launch date and fund- raising goals. There are other variables, which are being ignored.

 What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Plays are created by talented people so some kind of a talent index has to be there.  Resources are another big factor in production, but these graphs shows that less resources may not be a hindrance to success.

Dedication to the job and other psychological factors contribute to the success and failure of the production.
